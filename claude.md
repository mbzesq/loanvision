### **LoanVision Project State - 2025-06-19**

#### **1. High-Level Objective**
To build a SaaS platform for ingesting, enriching, and analyzing non-performing mortgage loan portfolios. The core idea is to provide automated data cleaning, enrichment, and an AI-powered query interface.

#### **2. Core Technology Stack**
* **Backend:** Node.js with Express, TypeScript
* **Frontend:** React with Vite, TypeScript
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Deployment:** Render
* **Code Repository:** GitHub

#### **3. Current Deployed State (What Works)**
* **Data Ingestion:** Users can successfully upload loan data via CSV/Excel files
* **Dashboard:** Homepage displays summary cards with live portfolio metrics
* **Loan Explorer Table:** Main data grid displays all loans with sorting and global search
* **Advanced Filter Panel:** Professional accordion-style filter panel with:
  - Property State filter with smart search (state names + abbreviations)
  - Asset Status filter with searchable options
  - Investor filter with searchable investor names
  - Lien Position filter with searchable position values
  - Principal Balance range filter (min/max inputs)
  - Selection counter badges showing active filter counts
  - Dismissible selection tags for easy management
  - Apply and Reset functionality working correctly
* **Professional DataToolbar:** Modern header component featuring:
  - Results summary showing "Viewing X of Y loans"
  - Enhanced search input with refined styling
  - Functional Export dropdown with PDF and Excel options
  - Stubbed buttons for future features (Save View, Compare)
* **Loan Detail Modal:** Clicking loan rows opens detailed information modal
* **Report Exporting:** Users can export current view to both Excel and PDF formats
* **Global Professional Theme:** 
  - Inter font family applied application-wide
  - Professional blue accent color for primary actions
  - Light gray background with optimized text contrast
  - Consistent Schwab-inspired design aesthetic

#### **4. Evergreen Rules & Guardrails for the AI**

**Workflow Rules:**
- **Production-First:** Every new feature is built, deployed to a live URL, and tested by the project lead before moving on
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** A human project lead oversees the process, provides high-level feature instructions, and performs final code review before commits are pushed by the AI engineer
- **Single Source of Truth:** This project state document is the definitive record of the project's state

**Technical Guardrails:**
- **Final Action:** After completing a development task, you must commit the changes and push them to the main branch on GitHub
- **Render Build Commands:** Use npm cache clean --force && npm install && ... as the base for build commands
- **Database Schema:** Use the psql command-line tool via a DROP and CREATE script

#### **5. Last Session Summary**
Successfully completed a comprehensive UI/UX overhaul and technical improvements:

**Major Features Implemented:**
- **Selection Counter Badges:** Added visual feedback showing active filter counts in accordion headers
- **Search-Within-Filter:** Implemented real-time search functionality for all filter categories
- **Dismissible Selection Tags:** Added removable badges showing current selections with X buttons

- **Dependency Management:** Added missing @radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu to shared workspace
- **Component Architecture:** Extracted reusable ExportButton component with proper state management

**Design Improvements:**
