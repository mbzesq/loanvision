## 1. High-Level Objective
To build a SaaS platform for ingesting, enriching, analyzing, and managing non-performing mortgage loan portfolios. The platform helps asset managers make better decisions by combining structured loan data, automated enrichment, and intelligent querying.

---

## 2. Core User Personas

### üë§ Alex the Active Manager
The primary user for the current phase. Alex is a portfolio analyst or asset manager responsible for hands-on review of individual loans and overall performance. They need real-time visibility into loan status, risk, and foreclosure pipeline.

### üë©‚Äçüíº Sarah the Passive Investor *(Future)*
Sarah is a stakeholder or capital partner. She prefers high-level dashboards, summaries, and trend visualizations instead of detailed loan-level data.

---

## 3. Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Render.com (split frontend/backend)
- **Repo**: [GitHub - nplvision](https://github.com/mbzesq/nplvision)

## 4. Current System Capabilities

### ‚úÖ Upload Engine (CSV + XLSX)
- Supports file uploads for:
  - Daily Portfolio Metrics
  - Foreclosure Events
- Dynamically detects column headers
- Accepts `.csv` and `.xlsx` formats

### ‚úÖ Database Support for Current + History Tables
- **daily_metrics_current**: Latest view per loan
- **daily_metrics_history**: Full audit trail by `loan_id + report_date`
- **foreclosure_events**: Current foreclosure status (one active per loan)
- **foreclosure_events_history**: Tracks all filings, including multiple foreclosure cycles
- **Automatic handling of historical preservation and active-state logic**

### ‚úÖ UI/UX Enhancements & Branding (2025-06-27D)
The application now features a polished, professional user interface with consistent NPLVision branding.

**Completed Features:**
- **Relocated User Profile Menu**: Moved from sidebar bottom to header dropdown with professional styling
- **NPL Logo Integration**: Custom SVG logo component replacing text branding throughout the application
- **Responsive Design**: User profile dropdown works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile layouts
- **Consistent Branding**: Updated all text references from "LoanVision" to "NPLVision" across login and registration pages
- **Enhanced UX**: Added UserCircle icon, hover states, and red-styled logout button for better visual affordance

**Core Application Status:**
- ‚úÖ **Functional Data Pipeline**: Backend data ingestion working correctly for daily_metrics and foreclosure_events
- ‚úÖ **Functional Loan Explorer**: Main explorer page displays loan data with working filter panel
- ‚úÖ **Functional Authentication**: Login, registration, and user profile management working properly
- ‚úÖ **Functional Upload System**: File upload and processing capabilities operational

**Known Issue (Lower Priority):**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Foreclosure Timeline**: Modal timeline section may need attention (not critical for current operations)

### ‚úÖ Backend Infrastructure
- Corrected `fcl_milestones_by_state.json` path resolution
- Dynamic ingestion logic with robust logging
- Upload responses include insert/skipped/error counts and `report_date`

## 5. Evergreen Guardrails for AI (Claude)

### üõ°Ô∏è Stability First
- Never break working features; always preserve Loan Explorer, Upload, and Dashboard stability

### üß† Claude is Not All-Knowing
- Must use explicitly shared schemas and sample data
- Cannot infer structure from uploads‚Äîrequire clear mapping

### üß™ Nothing Is Trusted Until Verified
- All changes must be tested via Upload
- Deployment must follow validation in dev or local

### üß± Clear & Modular Design
- Code must be testable and organized
- Favor named helpers and TS interfaces

### üß≠ Project State Must Be Current
- Always begin with updated `claude.md`
- Time-stamp major changes (e.g. `v2025-06-20D`)

### üß∞ Build for the Future
- Plan for FTP automation, servicer-specific templates, and dashboard analytics
- Implement config toggles or placeholders for planned features
