# Unified Inbox System Status Update - 07-09-2025

## Executive Summary
The Unified Inbox System has been successfully implemented as a comprehensive communication and task management hub for NPLVision. This Bloomberg Terminal-inspired interface consolidates alerts, tasks, and user communications into a single, threaded messaging system with real-time functionality and full database integration.

## Project Scope & Objectives

### Primary Goal
Replace the separate "Today" page alerts and tasks with a unified inbox that serves as the central command center for all portfolio operations, combining:

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Core inbox table with full audit trail
inbox_items (
  id, external_id, type, subject, body, priority, status, source,
  category, created_by_user_id, assigned_to_user_id, thread_id,
  reply_to_id, loan_ids[], due_date, estimated_duration,
  completion_notes, created_at, updated_at
)

-- Multi-user messaging support
inbox_recipients (
  inbox_item_id, user_id, recipient_type, read_at, created_at
)

-- File attachment system
inbox_attachments (
  inbox_item_id, file_name, file_size, file_type, storage_path, created_at
)

-- Complete audit trail
inbox_activity_log (
  inbox_item_id, user_id, action, old_values, new_values, created_at
)
```

### API Design
RESTful endpoints with JWT authentication, comprehensive filtering, and permission-based access control. All endpoints support standard HTTP methods with proper error handling and response formatting.
