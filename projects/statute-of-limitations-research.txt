Comprehensive 51-Jurisdiction Analysis
of Mortgage Foreclosure Statutes of
Limitations for Mortgage-Backed
Security Investors
I. Executive Summary & Strategic Overview

A. Introduction and Purpose

This report provides a comprehensive legal and analytical framework for understanding
mortgage foreclosure statutes of limitations (SOL) across all 50 states and the District of
Columbia. It is designed for Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) investors to assess and
mitigate risks associated with the enforceability of mortgage liens over time, particularly within
portfolios of non-performing and re-performing loans. The enforceability of a mortgage is not
perpetual; it is governed by a complex web of state-specific statutes and interpretive case law
that dictates the maximum time a lender has to initiate a foreclosure action. Failure to comply
with these time limits can, in many jurisdictions, result in the complete extinguishment of the
security interest, rendering the collateral worthless and leading to a total loss on the investment.
This analysis provides the detailed, jurisdiction-specific intelligence necessary for prudent risk
management, asset valuation, and investment strategy in the MBS market.

B. Key Findings at a Glance

A nationwide survey reveals extreme variance in foreclosure SOL regimes, posing a significant
challenge for investors with geographically diverse portfolios. Key findings include:
• Divergent Time Periods: The time allowed to initiate foreclosure varies dramatically,
from as short as four years in Texas and five years in Florida to 15 years in Michigan and
as long as 60 years in specific circumstances in California.1 This disparity directly impacts
the risk profile of aged delinquent loans.
• Critical Triggering Events: The event that starts the SOL clock is a pivotal and often
litigated issue. The three primary triggers are (1) the date of each missed installment

•

•

payment, giving rise to a rolling SOL for each payment; (2) the lender's affirmative
acceleration of the entire loan balance, which typically starts a single, final SOL period for
the whole debt; and (3) the loan's contractual maturity date.5 The legal interpretation of
what constitutes a valid acceleration or a subsequent "deceleration" is a major source of
legal risk.
The Lien's Fate: A crucial distinction exists between states where an expired SOL
extinguishes the underlying mortgage lien itself, rendering the debt unsecured (e.g.,
Texas 6), and states where it merely bars the
remedy of foreclosure, potentially leaving a "zombie mortgage" that still clouds title and
may be satisfied upon a future sale of the property (e.g., Ohio 7).
Legislative Volatility: The legal landscape is not static. Recent legislative actions, most
notably New York's Foreclosure Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA), have radically altered the
risk calculus for lenders. FAPA prevents lenders from unilaterally revoking a prior
acceleration to reset the SOL, a practice that was previously a key risk mitigant.8 This
trend toward borrower-protective legislation underscores the need for continuous
monitoring.

C. Jurisdictional Risk "Heat Map" for MBS Investors

For the purposes of portfolio risk assessment, jurisdictions can be categorized into conceptual
risk tiers based on the confluence of SOL period, trigger mechanisms, and the consequence of
expiration.
• High-Risk Jurisdictions: These states present the greatest risk of collateral loss due to
strict and unforgiving SOL regimes. They are typically characterized by short SOL periods
(4-6 years), triggers based on acceleration that can be inadvertently but irrevocably
activated by routine servicing communications, and statutes that extinguish the lien upon
expiration. New York (post-FAPA) and Texas are prime examples. In these states, a
single procedural misstep or delay in a foreclosure action can lead to a complete write-off
of the asset.
• Medium-Risk Jurisdictions: This category includes states with moderate SOL periods
(e.g., 10-15 years) or where the legal framework is ambiguous or in flux. Ohio and Illinois
fit this profile. Ohio, for instance, has conflicting lines of case law regarding whether the
expiration of the SOL on the promissory note bars an action on the mortgage, creating
significant legal uncertainty.10 Illinois has a 10-year SOL but case law suggests that if the
action on the note is barred, the mortgage lien may also be unenforceable.12 These states
require careful, case-by-case analysis and present moderate risk.
• Low-Risk Jurisdictions: These states offer a more stable and predictable environment
for lien enforcement. They are characterized by very long SOL periods or triggers tied to
the loan's final maturity date, which provides a clear and extended window for
enforcement. California, with its 60-year SOL for deeds of trust lacking a recorded
maturity date, and South Carolina, with its 20-year SOL from maturity, are examples of
lower-risk jurisdictions from a purely temporal perspective.4

D. Overarching Strategic Implications

This analysis yields several critical strategic imperatives for MBS investors:
1. Servicing is Paramount: The complexity and variance of SOL triggers mean that loan
servicing cannot be a passive, automated process. The language used in default notices
and acceleration letters has profound legal consequences and can inadvertently start an
SOL clock that the servicer is not prepared to manage.1
2. Due Diligence is Non-Negotiable: The value of a non-performing loan is directly tied to
the enforceability of its underlying lien. Investors must incorporate a loan-level SOL
analysis into the due diligence and pricing of any MBS acquisition. A loan's date of
origination is far less important than its default and acceleration history.8
3. Bankruptcy is a Universal Constant: Across all jurisdictions, the automatic stay
imposed by a borrower's bankruptcy filing is the most common and reliable tolling event,
pausing the SOL clock pursuant to federal law.15 Understanding the interplay between the
federal bankruptcy stay and state-specific SOL rules is essential for managing timelines
on distressed assets.

III. Detailed Jurisdictional Analysis
This section provides an in-depth analysis of the foreclosure statute of limitations for each of the
51 jurisdictions. Each entry details the applicable time periods, trigger events, the impact of
foreclosure method, rules for tolling, and the ultimate effect of an expired statute on the
mortgage lien.

Alabama

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Alabama is primarily a non-judicial foreclosure state,
where lenders utilize a "power of sale" clause contained within the mortgage or deed of
trust to sell the property at auction without extensive court oversight.17 While a judicial
foreclosure process exists, it is less common.18 The statutory framework for limitations is
multifaceted. An action on a written contract (the promissory note) is subject to a
6-year SOL.19 For contracts executed "under seal," this period extends to
10 years.19 However, the most critical period for lien enforceability is the common law
"rule of prescription" or doctrine of laches, which establishes a presumptive
20-year period after which a mortgage lien is considered extinguished if there has been
no recognition of the debt.
Triggering Events: The 20-year prescriptive period for the mortgage lien is generally
understood to run from the final maturity date of the loan. In contrast, the shorter 6-year
SOL on the promissory note begins to run from the date of the borrower's default or the
lender's subsequent acceleration of the debt.17

•

•

Tolling: General principles of tolling apply. A borrower's bankruptcy filing imposes an
automatic stay on collection activities, which will toll the running of the SOL for the
duration of the stay, consistent with federal law under 11 U.S.C. § 108(c).20
Effect of Expiration: The expiration of the 6-year SOL on the promissory note bars the
lender from obtaining a personal deficiency judgment against the borrower after a
foreclosure sale. However, it does not extinguish the mortgage lien itself or the power to
foreclose within the longer prescriptive period.19 If the 20-year prescriptive period lapses
without any action by the lender or acknowledgment by the borrower, the mortgage lien is
considered extinguished and unenforceable, barring foreclosure entirely. Alabama law
also provides a statutory post-sale right of redemption, typically for one year, which allows
the foreclosed homeowner to reclaim the property by paying the full purchase price plus
costs and interest.21

Alaska

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Alaska permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with the non-judicial "power of sale" method being the most common for
residential properties.22 The SOL to foreclose a deed of trust is
10 years from the maturity date of the obligation.22 The SOL to bring an action on the
underlying promissory note is
6 years from the accrual of the cause of action (e.g., default or acceleration).22 For other
contracts, the SOL is
3 years.24
Triggering Events: The 10-year period for foreclosing the deed of trust is explicitly tied to
the maturity date of the loan. The 6-year period for an action on the note is triggered by
default or acceleration of the debt.
Tolling: The SOL is tolled during a bankruptcy stay pursuant to federal law.25 Alaska
statutes do not provide for extensive state-specific tolling provisions for mortgage
foreclosure outside of general principles.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 6-year SOL on the note would bar a deficiency
judgment. Expiration of the 10-year SOL on the deed of trust extinguishes the power of
sale, rendering the lien unenforceable through non-judicial foreclosure. The underlying
debt, if not time-barred, would become unsecured.

Arizona

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Arizona is predominantly a non-judicial foreclosure
state, utilizing deeds of trust with a power of sale.26 A judicial foreclosure process is also
available but is less common.27 The SOL for an action on a debt evidenced by a written
contract, which includes both the promissory note and the deed of trust, is
6 years.28
Triggering Events: The 6-year SOL accrues when the cause of action arises. For an
installment contract like a mortgage, a separate cause of action accrues for each missed
payment. Therefore, a lender can foreclose on any payments that have defaulted within

•

•

the preceding 6 years. If the lender formally accelerates the loan, the 6-year SOL begins
to run on the entire outstanding balance from the date of acceleration.28
Tolling: A bankruptcy filing by the borrower will toll the SOL for the duration of the
automatic stay under 11 U.S.C. § 108(c). Arizona case law confirms that the enforcement
period is tolled while a creditor is precluded from collection attempts.15
Effect of Expiration: If the 6-year SOL expires on the entire accelerated debt, the lender
is barred from foreclosing or suing on the note. This effectively extinguishes the lender's
ability to recover the debt through the collateral. However, a recent appellate decision
concerning a land sale contract (where the seller retains title) suggests a critical nuance:
while the SOL may bar enforcement of the debt, it does not extinguish the lender's title to
the property, creating a complex legal situation where the lender cannot foreclose but still
holds legal title.28 For typical deeds of trust where title passes to the borrower at closing,
expiration of the SOL on the debt is generally understood to render the lien
unenforceable.

Arkansas

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Arkansas law permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures.29 The SOL for foreclosure is directly tied to the limitation period for a suit on
the underlying debt.30 For written contracts, this period is
5 years.30
Triggering Events: The 5-year SOL begins to run from the maturity date of the
indebtedness. A crucial feature of Arkansas law is that for any partial payments to extend
the SOL as to third parties (like junior lienholders or subsequent purchasers), the payment
must be noted on the margin of the mortgage record in the county land records. If
payments are not so noted, the lien becomes unenforceable as to third parties 5 years
after the original maturity date or 5 years from the last payment that was noted on the
record.30
Tolling: A bankruptcy filing will toll the SOL.32 Arkansas law also provides for tolling under
specific circumstances, such as for certain medical malpractice claims, but does not have
a broad, generally applicable tolling statute for foreclosures outside of bankruptcy and
common law principles.33
Effect of Expiration: The statute explicitly states that if a foreclosure suit is not brought
within the limitation period for the underlying debt, it is a "sufficient defense".30 This
effectively bars the foreclosure action and renders the lien unenforceable. The debt
becomes unsecured.

California

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: California allows both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, though the non-judicial power of sale process is overwhelmingly favored due
to its efficiency and cost-effectiveness.34 The SOL framework is distinctly different for each
method.

Judicial Foreclosure: This court-supervised process is subject to a 4-year SOL,
which aligns with the statute for actions on written contracts. The action must be
commenced within four years of the default on the underlying promissory note.4
o Non-Judicial Foreclosure: The power of sale under a deed of trust has a much
longer and more complex limitation period. Under Cal. Civ. Code § 2911, the lien
expires and the power of sale becomes unenforceable at the later of two dates:
1. 10 years after the final maturity date of the loan, if that date is
"ascertainable from the record."
2. 60 years from the date the deed of trust was recorded, if the final maturity
date is not ascertainable from the public record.4
Triggering Events: For a judicial foreclosure, the 4-year clock is triggered by the
borrower's default on the promissory note.4 For a non-judicial foreclosure, the trigger is
not the default but rather the
maturity date or the recording date of the instrument, as described above. A lender's
acceleration of the note does not start the 10/60 year clock for exercising the power of
sale, a point of immense strategic importance for lenders.
Tolling: The SOL is tolled during a borrower's bankruptcy proceeding due to the
automatic stay, as provided by 11 U.S.C. § 108(c).15
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 4-year SOL on the note bars the remedy of a
judicial foreclosure and extinguishes the lien for that purpose.36 Critically, it does
not affect the lender's ability to use the non-judicial power of sale, provided the 10/60 year
period has not expired. When the 10/60 year period under Cal. Civ. Code § 2911 expires,
the lien is extinguished for all purposes, and the power of sale becomes void and
unenforceable.4
Analysis of the "Ascertainable from the Record" Provision: The bifurcated 10/60 year
rule for non-judicial foreclosures creates a significant analytical challenge for investors.
Lenders frequently omit the maturity date from the original recorded deed of trust
specifically to benefit from the longer 60-year period.4 However, the life of a loan can
involve subsequent recorded documents. For instance, if a borrower defaults and then
enters into a loan modification, that modification agreement is often recorded. If the
recorded modification contains a new, specific maturity date, that date is now
"ascertainable from the record." This act can inadvertently and irrevocably switch the
applicable SOL from the 60-year period (from the original recording) to the much shorter
10-year period running from the new maturity date. For an MBS investor acquiring a pool
of re-performing or modified loans, this means due diligence cannot stop at the original
deed of trust. A full review of the entire chain of recorded title documents is necessary to
accurately determine the operative SOL and assess the risk of lien expiration.

Colorado

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Colorado primarily utilizes a non-judicial foreclosure
process overseen by a public trustee in each county.38 A judicial foreclosure process is
also available but is less common. The SOL for an action on the promissory note is
6 years.38
Triggering Events: The trigger for the 6-year SOL is nuanced. A cause of action accrues
for each missed installment payment, starting a separate 6-year clock for that specific
payment. If a lender chooses to accelerate the debt, the 6-year SOL begins to run on the

•
•

entire outstanding balance from the date of acceleration. However, if the lender does not
accelerate the debt despite a default, the SOL on the entire principal balance does not
begin to run until the loan's contractual maturity date.38 This gives lenders significant
flexibility and can extend the enforcement window for many years past the initial default.
Tolling: Standard tolling principles, including for bankruptcy, apply.
Effect of Expiration: If the 6-year SOL runs on the entire accelerated debt, the lender is
barred from obtaining a judgment on the note. This also bars the ability to foreclose.
Because Colorado law allows a lender to wait until the maturity date to sue for the full
amount if it never accelerated, a loan could be in default for many years, yet the SOL for
foreclosure on the principal balance may not have even started to run.38 This makes a
careful review of the servicing history and any acceleration notices critical to determining
enforceability.

Connecticut

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Connecticut is a judicial foreclosure state.41 The
process can result in a "strict foreclosure" (where the court transfers title directly to the
lender if there is no equity) or a "foreclosure by sale" (a public auction).41 Recent
legislation has substantially clarified the SOL. A foreclosure action on a residential
mortgage must be commenced by the earliest of:
1. 10 years from the final payment or maturity date stated in the loan documents (or
as extended in writing).
2. 10 years from the date of an uncured default.
3. 40 years from the date the mortgage was recorded (or executed, if unrecorded),
provided the repayment period is not longer than 40 years.43
Triggering Events: The statute provides three alternative triggers, with the one resulting
in the earliest expiration date controlling: the maturity date, the date of uncured default,
or the date of recording/execution. A payment on account after a default can reset the
10-year clock from the date of that payment.44
Tolling: The SOL is tolled during a bankruptcy stay.46 The statute also explicitly provides
that if a law or order prohibits foreclosure during the final 2 years of the limitation period,
the period is extended by the duration of the prohibition.43
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the SOL bars the commencement of a foreclosure
action. Furthermore, a related statute provides that an unreleased mortgage becomes
invalid as a lien 10 years after the time for full performance has expired (previously 20
years), provided the owner has been in undisturbed possession.44 This effectively
extinguishes the lien.

Delaware

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Delaware is a judicial foreclosure state, often utilizing a
specialized procedure known as scire facias sur-mortgage.48 The SOL framework is based
on lien expiration rather than a typical contract limitations period. A mortgage lien expires:

•

•

•

1. 10 years after the maturity date, if the maturity date is ascertainable from the
recorded mortgage.
2. 40 years from the date of recording, if the maturity date is not ascertainable from
the record.51
Triggering Events: The trigger is either the maturity date or the date of recording,
depending on the contents of the recorded mortgage instrument. Default or acceleration
are not the primary triggers for the lien expiration statute.
Tolling: General tolling principles apply, including for bankruptcy stays.52 Delaware law
also allows parties to a written contract over $100,000 to contractually extend the
limitations period up to 20 years.52
Effect of Expiration: The statute provides that upon expiration of the applicable 10 or 40year period, the mortgage lien is extinguished. An attorney can then follow a statutory
procedure to have the mortgage formally satisfied of record.51 The expiration of the lien
bars any foreclosure action.

District of Columbia

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: The District of Columbia permits both judicial and nonjudicial foreclosures.54 While non-judicial was historically more common, the introduction
of a mandatory mediation program for non-judicial cases led many lenders to shift to the
judicial process to bypass that requirement.54 The applicable SOL is
12 years for an action on an instrument under seal, which includes a deed of trust.55
Triggering Events: The 12-year period begins to run when the cause of action
accrues, which is generally the date of the borrower's default. If the debt is accelerated,
the cause of action for the entire balance accrues at that time.
Tolling: The SOL is tolled during a bankruptcy stay. General common law tolling
principles would also apply.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 12-year SOL bars the lender from bringing a
foreclosure action, either judicially or non-judicially. The lien becomes unenforceable.

Florida

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Florida is exclusively a judicial foreclosure state,
requiring a lawsuit to foreclose.56 The SOL to foreclose a mortgage is
5 years.2 A separate, much shorter
1-year SOL applies to actions for a deficiency judgment, running from the day after the
clerk issues the certificate of title following the foreclosure sale.14
Triggering Events: Florida law recognizes multiple trigger points, offering lenders
significant flexibility.
1. Each Missed Installment: A distinct 5-year SOL begins to run on each individual
monthly payment that is missed. A lender can initiate foreclosure based on any
default that occurred within the last 5 years.58
2. Acceleration: When the lender accelerates the loan, a single 5-year SOL
commences for the entire outstanding debt from the date of acceleration.

•

•

•

3. Maturity Date: If the loan is never accelerated, the right to foreclose on the final
principal balance accrues at the loan's maturity date, starting a 5-year SOL from
that point.14
Tolling & Resetting: A bankruptcy filing tolls the SOL.59 The most significant aspect of
Florida law is the "deceleration" rule established by the Florida Supreme Court in
Bartram v. U.S. Bank. The court held that when a foreclosure action is dismissed
(voluntarily or involuntarily, with or without prejudice), it has the legal effect of decelerating
the loan and returning the parties to their prior contractual relationship.14 This means that a
subsequent missed payment by the borrower constitutes a
new default, which starts a new 5-year SOL. This rule provides a powerful safety valve for
lenders, preventing a single failed foreclosure attempt from becoming fatal due to an
expired SOL.
Effect of Expiration: If the 5-year SOL runs on the entire accelerated balance and the
action is not saved by the Bartram rule, the foreclosure is barred. However, the lien itself
is not automatically extinguished by the SOL on the foreclosure remedy. A separate
"statute of repose," Fla. Stat. § 95.281, provides an ultimate end date for the lien's validity:
5 years after the maturity date (if ascertainable from the record) or 20 years from the
mortgage date (if not ascertainable).61 After this period, the lien terminates.
Analysis of the Bartram "Reset" Rule: The Bartram decision makes Florida a
comparatively lower-risk state for MBS investors regarding SOLs. Unlike jurisdictions like
New York post-FAPA, where a dismissed foreclosure after the SOL has run can be
catastrophic, Florida provides a clear judicial mechanism to "reset" the clock. For an
investor, this means that a portfolio of non-performing Florida loans has a higher
probability of ultimate recovery, even if prior foreclosure attempts have failed. A servicer's
procedural error leading to dismissal does not necessarily result in a total loss of
collateral. The lender can simply wait for the borrower to miss the next post-dismissal
payment, which creates a fresh cause of action and a new 5-year window to foreclose.
This predictability is a significant positive factor in asset valuation.

Georgia

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Georgia is a non-judicial foreclosure state, relying on a
power of sale in the security deed.62 The SOL is not a fixed period for "foreclosure" but is
framed as a "reversion" of title. Title conveyed by a security deed automatically reverts to
the borrower:
1. 7 years after the maturity of the last installment stated or fixed in the recorded
document.
2. If no maturity date is stated, 7 years from the date of the conveyance.62
Triggering Events: The trigger is the maturity date or, if none is stated in the record, the
date of the security deed itself. A foreclosure action commenced before the reversion
date prevents the reversion from occurring, provided the foreclosure is completed without
undue delay.62
Tolling: A bankruptcy filing and the resulting automatic stay will toll the running of the
reversionary period.65 Georgia law also allows the lender to extend the reversion period by
filing a renewal affidavit on the public record before the initial period expires.62

•

Effect of Expiration: Once the 7-year period runs, title to the property automatically
reverts to the borrower by operation of law. The security deed becomes void, and the
lender loses its lien and the power to foreclose.62 The debt becomes unsecured.

Hawaii

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Hawaii permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, though recent legislative changes have pushed most residential
foreclosures into the judicial process.66 The SOL for an action on a promissory note or
mortgage is
6 years.67
Triggering Events: The 6-year SOL begins to run from the accrual of the cause of
action, which is typically the date of default or, if applicable, the date of acceleration.
Tolling: General tolling principles apply, including for bankruptcy.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 6-year SOL bars the foreclosure action. For
registered (Land Court) property, Hawaii law provides a powerful finality rule: once a new
certificate of title is issued to the purchaser after a foreclosure, the foreclosure proceeding
cannot be impeached or challenged, even if there were defects, including a potential SOL
violation.68 This provides significant protection to the finality of the foreclosure sale for
third-party purchasers and lenders who take title.

Idaho

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Idaho is primarily a non-judicial foreclosure state.69 The
SOL for foreclosing a mortgage on real property is
5 years.70
Triggering Events: The 5-year period runs from the maturity date of the obligation. If
the loan documents do not state a maturity date, the SOL runs from the date of the
accrual of the cause of action, which would be the date of default.70
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions, such as for a bankruptcy stay, apply.
Effect of Expiration: Failure to commence a foreclosure action within the 5-year period
bars the remedy and renders the lien unenforceable.71

Illinois

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Illinois is a judicial foreclosure state, requiring a lawsuit
to foreclose.72 The SOL for commencing a mortgage foreclosure action is
10 years.74 The SOL for an action on a written contract (the promissory note) is also 10
years.75

•
•

•

Triggering Events: The 10-year period begins to run after the right of action accrues,
which is typically the date of default or acceleration.72
Tolling: Illinois has a specific tolling statute, 735 ILCS 5/13-216, which states that when
the commencement of an action is stayed by a "statutory prohibition," the time of the
prohibition is not part of the limitation period. The automatic stay in bankruptcy is
considered such a statutory prohibition, meaning the SOL is tolled for the entire duration
of the bankruptcy case.77
Effect of Expiration: If the 10-year SOL on the note expires, Illinois case law suggests
that the mortgage lien, being merely an incident to the debt, is also extinguished and can
no longer be foreclosed.12 The reasoning is that the "existence of the debt...is essential to
the life of the mortgage," and when the debt is barred, the mortgage is gone.12 This makes
the expiration of the SOL fatal to the lien.

Indiana

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Indiana is a judicial foreclosure state.81 The SOL for
foreclosures is complex and depends on the mortgage's date and contents. For
mortgages executed
after June 30, 2012:
1. If the maturity date is ascertainable from the record, the lien expires 10 years after
the maturity date.
2. If the maturity date is not ascertainable but the execution date is, the lien expires 10
years after the execution date.
3. If neither date is ascertainable, the lien expires 10 years after the recording date.83
For mortgages executed before July 1, 2012, the periods are 20 years instead of
10.84
Triggering Events: The trigger is determined by the contents of the recorded mortgage,
based on the maturity date, execution date, or recording date as outlined above.
Indiana courts have also recognized that for installment loans, a cause of action accrues
on each missed payment, and a lender can sue for the entire amount within six years of
the final maturity date if it chooses not to accelerate.85
Tolling: Indiana law provides for tolling of the SOL in specific circumstances, such as for
persons under a legal disability or for nonresident defendants.87 A bankruptcy filing will
also toll the SOL.88
Effect of Expiration: The statute is clear that upon the expiration of the applicable 10 or
20-year period, the mortgage lien "expires".83 The lien is extinguished, and the foreclosure
remedy is barred. The property owner can request that the county recorder certify on the
record that the lien is satisfied by lapse of time.84

Iowa

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Iowa permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, though judicial is common. The SOL for an action on a written contract is 10

•

•
•

years [Iowa Code § 614.1(5)]. A special statute provides that a mortgage foreclosure is
barred after 20 years from the date of the mortgage if the record does not show a maturity
date, or 10 years from the maturity date if one is stated [Iowa Code § 614.21].
Triggering Events: The SOL is triggered by the accrual of the cause of action (default)
for the 10-year contract period, or by the mortgage date/maturity date for the 20/10 year
lien expiration statute.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply, including for bankruptcy stays.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the SOL bars the foreclosure action and extinguishes
the lien.

Kansas

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Kansas is a judicial foreclosure state. The SOL for an
action on a written agreement is 5 years. The SOL for foreclosure is tied to the
enforceability of the underlying note.
Triggering Events: The 5-year period begins to run when the cause of action accrues,
which is the date of default or acceleration.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply, including for bankruptcy stays.
Effect of Expiration: If the SOL on the note expires, the right to foreclose the mortgage
is also barred.

Kentucky

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Kentucky is a judicial foreclosure state; non-judicial
foreclosure is not permitted.89 The SOL framework has multiple layers. An action to
enforce a promissory note must be commenced within
6 years after the due date or acceleration.90 However, the SOL for an action on a written
contract is
15 years. Courts generally apply the longer 15-year period to the enforcement of the
mortgage lien itself.
Triggering Events: The SOL begins to run upon the accrual of the cause of action,
which is typically the date of default or acceleration.
Tolling: A bankruptcy filing will toll the SOL.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 6-year SOL on the note may bar a personal
deficiency judgment against the borrower. However, the lender may still be able to
enforce the mortgage lien via foreclosure within the longer 15-year period. Expiration of
the 15-year period bars the foreclosure action entirely.

Louisiana

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Louisiana is a judicial foreclosure state, but it offers
two distinct procedures: "ordinary process" (a standard lawsuit) and "executory process".91
Executory process is a faster, more streamlined judicial proceeding available when the
mortgage is in "authentic form" and contains a "confession of judgment" clause, which is
common.93 The time limit for enforcing a promissory note is known as a "prescriptive
period," which is
5 years [La. Civ. Code art. 3498].
Triggering Events: The 5-year prescriptive period begins to run from the time payment
is due. For an installment note, this can mean a separate period runs for each missed
installment. If the note is accelerated, the period runs on the entire debt from the date of
acceleration.
Tolling: The prescriptive period can be "interrupted" by the filing of a suit or by the
debtor's acknowledgment of the debt. It can be "suspended" for various reasons,
including a bankruptcy filing.95
Effect of Expiration: If the 5-year prescriptive period on the note runs without interruption
or suspension, the obligation is extinguished. Because the mortgage is an accessory to
the primary obligation (the note), the mortgage also becomes unenforceable, and
foreclosure is barred.96

Maine

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Maine is a judicial foreclosure state.97 The SOL for a
mortgage foreclosure action is
20 years.
Triggering Events: The 20-year period begins to run from the breach of a condition in
the mortgage, which is typically the date of default.
Tolling: Maine law recognizes tolling of the SOL, including for bankruptcy stays.98
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 20-year SOL bars the foreclosure action and
renders the mortgage lien unenforceable.99

Maryland

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Maryland is primarily a non-judicial foreclosure state.
A judicial process is also available. The law is unusual in that there is no specific statute
of limitations for a non-judicial foreclosure sale.100 However, other statutes create
effective time limits:
o An action on an instrument "under seal," such as a deed of trust, has a 12-year
SOL. This would apply to a judicial foreclosure.100
o More definitively, a statute of repose provides that a mortgage or deed of trust is not
enforceable if an action has not been brought within 12 years from the last
payment date or maturity date set forth in the instrument, or 40 years from the
date of recordation if no such date is included.100
Triggering Events: The triggers are the last payment date/maturity date or the
recordation date, as specified in the statute of repose.

•
•

Tolling: General tolling principles apply, including for bankruptcy.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the applicable period under the statute of repose
renders the mortgage lien unenforceable, barring foreclosure.

Massachusetts

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Massachusetts is primarily a non-judicial foreclosure
state, though it has a unique requirement for a judicial hearing under the Servicemembers
Civil Relief Act (SCRA) for all residential foreclosures.101 The SOL is complex and
governed by the state's "obsolete mortgage" statute:
1. For mortgages with a stated term or maturity date, the power of sale expires 5
years after the maturity date.
2. For mortgages with no stated term or maturity date, the power of sale expires 35
years from the date of recording.102
Triggering Events: The trigger is either the maturity date or the recording date,
depending on the mortgage's terms. The SOL can be extended by recording an extension
agreement or an affidavit of non-satisfaction before the original period expires.102
Tolling: The statute explicitly states that the period is not extended by non-residence,
disability, or partial payment.102 A bankruptcy stay, however, would toll the statute under
federal law.15
Effect of Expiration: Upon expiration of the applicable 5 or 35-year period, the statute
declares that the mortgage "shall be considered discharged for all purposes" without any
further action needed.102 This extinguishes the lien completely.

Michigan

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Michigan permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with the non-judicial "foreclosure by advertisement" being the most common
method.105 The SOL for foreclosing a mortgage, by either method, is
15 years.3 The SOL for suing on the promissory note is shorter, at
6 years.108
Triggering Events: The 15-year SOL for foreclosure begins to run from the later of two
dates: (1) when the mortgage becomes due (i.e., the maturity date), or (2) when the last
payment was made on the mortgage.3
Tolling: The SOL can be tolled by the filing of a complaint or by other events acquiring
jurisdiction over the defendant.110 A bankruptcy filing will also toll the statute. A partial
payment can restart the SOL clock.111
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 15-year SOL bars any action or proceeding to
foreclose the mortgage.3 The lien becomes unenforceable. Expiration of the 6-year SOL
on the note bars a deficiency judgment but does not prevent a timely foreclosure within
the 15-year window.112

Minnesota

•
•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Minnesota is primarily a non-judicial foreclosure state.
The SOL for foreclosure is 15 years from the maturity date of the mortgage.
Triggering Events: The 15-year period is triggered by the maturity date of the mortgage
debt.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply, including for bankruptcy.
Effect of Expiration: Once the 15-year period has run from the maturity date, the
mortgage lien ceases to be valid, and any action to foreclose is barred.

Mississippi

•

•
•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Mississippi allows both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with the non-judicial power of sale process being dominant.113 The SOL to
enforce a negotiable promissory note is
6 years.115 The general SOL for other actions is 3 years.115 The SOL for foreclosure is tied
to the enforceability of the underlying debt. There is a separate
1-year SOL to bring an action for a deficiency judgment after the foreclosure sale.115
Triggering Events: The 6-year SOL on the note is triggered by the stated maturity date
or, if applicable, the accelerated due date.116
Tolling: Mississippi law provides for tolling if a notice of claim is filed with a governmental
entity, but general foreclosure tolling relies on common law principles and the federal
bankruptcy stay.117
Effect of Expiration: If the SOL on the underlying debt expires, the remedy on the
mortgage is also barred. The lien becomes unenforceable. The statute explicitly states
that the expiration of a limitations period does not prevent property from being considered
"abandoned" under the state's unclaimed property act, but this is distinct from lien
enforceability.118

Missouri

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Missouri is a non-judicial foreclosure state. The SOL
for an action on a written promise to pay money is 10 years. The mortgage lien itself
expires 20 years after the maturity date stated in the mortgage.
Triggering Events: The 10-year SOL on the note is triggered by the accrual of the
cause of action (default). The 20-year lien expiration is triggered by the maturity date.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 10-year SOL on the note bars a deficiency
judgment. The lien itself remains enforceable until the 20-year period from maturity
expires, at which point it is extinguished.

Montana

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Montana permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with non-judicial being common for properties under 40 acres via the Small
Tract Financing Act (STFA).119 The SOL for enforcing a mortgage is
8 years after the maturity of the debt.120
Triggering Events: The 8-year period runs from the maturity date of the entire
obligation. The period can be renewed for an additional 8 years by recording an affidavit
before the original period expires.120
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply, including for bankruptcy.
Effect of Expiration: After the 8-year period (or any valid extension) expires, the
mortgage is no longer a valid lien against the property, and foreclosure is barred.

Nebraska

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Nebraska is a non-judicial foreclosure state. The SOL
for an action upon a written contract is 5 years. The SOL for foreclosure is tied to this
period.
Triggering Events: The 5-year period begins when the cause of action accrues, which
is the date of default or acceleration.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 5-year SOL bars the foreclosure action and
renders the lien unenforceable.

Nevada

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Nevada allows both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with the non-judicial process being the most common.121 The SOL for an
action on a written contract is
6 years.
Triggering Events: The 6-year SOL accrues from the date of the breach of contract
(default) or acceleration.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply. Making a payment on a time-barred debt can
restart the SOL.
Effect of Expiration: If the SOL on the underlying note expires, the right to foreclose is
also extinguished. The debt becomes time-barred, and while the debt collector can still
attempt to collect, they cannot use the courts to enforce it.123

New Hampshire

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: New Hampshire is primarily a non-judicial foreclosure
state, utilizing a power of sale.124 The SOL for an action for the recovery of real estate is
20 years.125 The SOL for an action on the promissory note is
6 years from the due date or acceleration.126
Triggering Events: The 20-year SOL for foreclosure begins when the right to recover
first accrued (i.e., upon default). The 6-year SOL on the note is triggered by the due
date or acceleration.
Tolling: A bankruptcy filing tolls the SOL pursuant to 11 U.S.C. § 108(c), which provides
a minimum 30-day window after the stay is lifted, but does not create a day-for-day tolling
independent of state law.127
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 6-year SOL on the note bars a deficiency
judgment. However, the foreclosure itself is governed by the longer 20-year period. If the
20-year period expires, the foreclosure is barred, and the lien is rendered unenforceable.

New Jersey

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: New Jersey is a judicial foreclosure state.128 A 2019 law
significantly changed the SOL for residential mortgages. The action must now be
commenced by the
earliest of the following dates:
1. 6 years from the maturity date.
2. 36 years from the date the mortgage was recorded.
3. 6 years from the date of the uncured default (this was changed from a 20-year
period).129
Triggering Events: The statute provides three distinct triggers—maturity date,
recording date, and date of default—with the shortest resulting period being the
controlling one.
Tolling: A partial payment or written acknowledgment of the debt can reset the SOL
clock.132 A bankruptcy filing will also toll the statute.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the applicable SOL period bars the commencement of
a foreclosure action, rendering the lien unenforceable.

New Mexico

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: New Mexico is primarily a judicial foreclosure state,
though a non-judicial process exists but is rarely used.133 The SOL for an action founded
upon a written contract or promissory note is
6 years.133

•
•
•

Triggering Events: The 6-year period commences when the cause of action accrues,
which is the date of default or acceleration.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply, including for bankruptcy.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 6-year SOL bars the foreclosure action. The debt
becomes time-barred, and the lien is unenforceable.135

New York

•

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: New York is a judicial foreclosure state.136 The SOL for
a mortgage foreclosure action is
6 years.8
Triggering Events: The 6-year SOL is triggered when the lender accelerates the
mortgage debt. This is a singular event that starts the clock on the entire debt. An
acceleration can occur through a clear and unequivocal demand letter or, most
commonly, by the filing of a foreclosure complaint.138 Without acceleration, a separate 6year SOL runs on each missed installment.139
Tolling & Resetting: A bankruptcy filing tolls the SOL for the duration of the automatic
stay.140 The most significant development is the 2022
Foreclosure Abuse Prevention Act (FAPA).
o Pre-FAPA: Under the Engel court decision, a lender could unilaterally revoke a
prior acceleration simply by voluntarily discontinuing its foreclosure lawsuit. This
action stopped the 6-year SOL from running and allowed the lender to re-accelerate
and file a new foreclosure later.8
o Post-FAPA: FAPA legislatively overruled Engel. Now, once a loan is accelerated,
the 6-year SOL continues to run regardless of whether the lender discontinues the
action. A lender cannot unilaterally de-accelerate the loan or reset the SOL clock.
Any extension or waiver of the SOL must be in a written agreement with the
borrower.8
Effect of Expiration: If the 6-year SOL expires after acceleration, the foreclosure action
is permanently barred. The homeowner can then bring a "quiet title" action under Real
Property Actions and Proceedings Law (RPAPL) § 1501(4) to have the court declare the
mortgage cancelled and discharged of record.142 The expiration of the SOL effectively
extinguishes the lien.
Analysis of FAPA's Impact: FAPA has transformed New York into one of the highestrisk jurisdictions for MBS investors holding non-performing loans. The law removes the
lender's ability to correct procedural errors by discontinuing and refiling. A single
foreclosure action that is commenced and later dismissed for any reason after the 6-year
SOL has run from the initial acceleration will likely result in a total loss of the collateral.
This places an immense premium on flawless and expeditious prosecution of foreclosures
in New York. Investors must re-evaluate any New York assets where a foreclosure was
commenced more than six years ago, as they carry a heightened risk of being rendered
unenforceable.

North Carolina

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: North Carolina uses a quasi-judicial foreclosure
process. It is a non-judicial power of sale that requires a preliminary hearing before the
clerk of court to obtain an order authorizing the sale.144 The SOL for foreclosure of a
mortgage where the mortgagor has been in possession is
10 years.146 The SOL for an action on a written contract is 3 years, or 10 years if under
seal.148
Triggering Events: The 10-year foreclosure SOL begins to run after the forfeiture of the
mortgage or after the power of sale becomes absolute (i.e., upon default).146
Tolling: A bankruptcy filing tolls the SOL under federal law.15 A partial payment or a
written acknowledgment of the debt can reset the SOL on the note.148
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 10-year SOL bars the foreclosure proceeding.
North Carolina case law suggests that if the underlying debt is barred, the mortgage
securing it is also unenforceable.147 A separate statute creates a presumption that a lien
expires 15 years after the maturity date, but this presumption primarily benefits
subsequent creditors and purchasers for value, not the original borrower.149

North Dakota

•
•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: North Dakota is a judicial foreclosure state. The SOL
for foreclosing a mortgage is 10 years from the last payment due date.
Triggering Events: The 10-year period is triggered by the last payment due date as
stated in the mortgage.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 10-year SOL bars the foreclosure action and
renders the lien unenforceable.

Ohio

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Ohio is a judicial foreclosure state.150 Its SOL regime is
one of the most complex and litigated in the country, with separate and distinct limitation
periods for the note and the mortgage.
o Action on the Note: The SOL for an action on a promissory note (a written
contract) is 6 years from the due date or acceleration. This period was changed
from 8 years in 2021, which itself was changed from 15 years in 2012. The
applicable period depends on when the cause of action accrued.10
o Action on the Mortgage (Foreclosure): The SOL for an action on the mortgage
itself is currently governed by the written contract statute (6 years, formerly 8).
However, Ohio courts have held that an action in ejectment, another remedy
available to a mortgagee, has a 21-year SOL.10

Lien Expiration: A separate statute of repose, R.C. 5301.30, provides that a
mortgage lien expires 21 years after the later of the mortgage date or the stated
maturity date, as to subsequent bona fide purchasers.156
Triggering Events: The SOL on the note is triggered by the due date of each installment
or by acceleration of the entire debt.10 The SOL on the mortgage action is triggered by
the
breach of the condition (default).
Tolling: A bankruptcy filing tolls the SOL. The federal code provides an extension until 30
days after the stay terminates.157 Ohio's general tolling statutes for absence from the state
or legal disability also apply.158
Effect of Expiration: This is the central point of conflict in Ohio law. The Ohio Supreme
Court held in Deutsche Bank v. Holden that an action on the note is separate and distinct
from an action on the mortgage.155 Following this, some Ohio appellate courts have ruled
that even if the 6-year SOL on the note expires (barring a personal deficiency judgment),
a lender can still pursue an
in rem foreclosure action on the mortgage within the longer limitation periods.7 However,
federal bankruptcy courts in Ohio, citing older Ohio Supreme Court precedent (
Hopkins v. Clyde), have held the opposite: that the mortgage is merely an incident of the
debt, and if the SOL bars action on the note, the foreclosure action is also barred.11 This
split in authority creates significant uncertainty for investors.
Analysis of Ohio's Legal Uncertainty: The conflicting lines of authority between Ohio's
state appellate courts and the federal bankruptcy courts within the state create a high-risk
environment. An MBS investor cannot be certain which SOL will be applied. If the federal
court view prevails, an Ohio loan is functionally similar to a New York loan, with a 6-year
"death clock" on the lien. If the state appellate view prevails, the lien survives much
longer, preserving collateral value even if a deficiency is uncollectible. This uncertainty
must be priced into any Ohio-based MBS, and foreclosure actions in Ohio should be
pursued with the more conservative 6-year SOL in mind to mitigate the risk of a total loss.

Oklahoma

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Oklahoma permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with judicial being more common.161 The SOL for an action on a written
contract (the note) is
5 years. A separate statute provides that a mortgage lien ceases to be a lien 10 years
after the last maturing obligation becomes due.163
Triggering Events: The 5-year SOL on the note is triggered by the accrual of the cause
of action (default or acceleration). The 10-year lien expiration is triggered by the final
maturity date of the loan.
Tolling: Oklahoma law provides for tolling, and a bankruptcy stay will also toll the
statute.164
Effect of Expiration: If the 5-year SOL on the note expires, a deficiency judgment is
barred. If the 10-year period from maturity expires, the mortgage lien itself ceases to exist,
and foreclosure is barred.163

Oregon

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Oregon allows both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with non-judicial being the standard method.165 The SOL for foreclosure is
10 years.167 The SOL for an action on the note is 6 years.
Triggering Events: The 10-year foreclosure SOL runs from the later of: the maturity date
of the debt, the expiration of the term of the debt, or the date to which payment has been
extended by a recorded agreement.167
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply, including for bankruptcy.
Effect of Expiration: After the 10-year period expires, the statute provides that the
mortgage "shall not be a lien upon such property".167 This extinguishes the lien and bars
foreclosure.

Pennsylvania

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Pennsylvania is a judicial foreclosure state.168 The SOL
is typically
4 years for an action on a contract.169 However, mortgages in Pennsylvania are often
considered "instruments under seal," which are subject to a
20-year SOL.
Triggering Events: The SOL begins to run on the date the debt comes due, i.e., upon
default.169
Tolling: A partial payment or a new written promise to pay can reset the SOL clock.169 A
bankruptcy filing will also toll the statute.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the applicable SOL (most conservatively, 4 years)
bars the foreclosure action. A judgment lien in Pennsylvania is valid for 5 years but can be
revived, potentially extending enforceability.170

Rhode Island

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Rhode Island permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with non-judicial being the most common.171 The general SOL for civil
actions, including those on written contracts like mortgages, is
10 years.173
Triggering Events: The 10-year period begins when the cause of action accrues,
which is the date of default or acceleration.
Tolling: A partial payment or written acknowledgment of the debt can restart the SOL
clock.173 A bankruptcy filing will also toll the statute.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 10-year SOL bars the creditor from filing a lawsuit
to foreclose.173 The lien becomes unenforceable through legal action.

South Carolina

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: South Carolina is a judicial foreclosure state.175 The
SOL for a mortgage lien is
20 years.13
Triggering Events: The 20-year period runs from the date for the maturity of the lien. If
no maturity date is stated, it runs from the date of the mortgage. The period can be
extended by recording a note of payment or a written acknowledgment of the debt before
the original period expires.13
Tolling: The SOL is tolled during a bankruptcy stay.177
Effect of Expiration: After the 20-year period lapses, the mortgage no longer constitutes
a lien on the real estate, and foreclosure is barred.13

South Dakota

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: South Dakota is primarily a non-judicial foreclosure
state. The SOL for foreclosing a mortgage is 15 years after the cause of action has
accrued.
Triggering Events: The 15-year period is triggered by the accrual of the cause of
action, which is the date of default.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 15-year SOL bars the foreclosure action.

Tennessee

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Tennessee allows both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with non-judicial being the standard.179 The SOL for an action to enforce a
promissory note is
6 years.180 The right to foreclose is generally tied to the enforceability of the note.
Triggering Events: The 6-year SOL runs from the due date or, if accelerated, the
accelerated due date.180 For a demand note where no demand is made, the action is
barred if no payments have been made for a continuous period of 10 years.180
Tolling: Tennessee has a specific statute that tolls the limitations period for enforcing
liens when a creditor is stayed by a bankruptcy filing.181
Effect of Expiration: If the 6-year SOL on the note expires, the right to foreclose the
mortgage is also barred, and the lien becomes unenforceable.123

Texas

•

•

•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Texas is a non-judicial foreclosure state, though a
judicial process is also available.182 The SOL for both judicial and non-judicial foreclosure
is
4 years.1
Triggering Events: The 4-year SOL begins to run on the accrual of the cause of
action. For an installment loan, this can be the final maturity date of the note. However,
if the lender accelerates the debt, the 4-year period begins to run immediately from the
date of acceleration. A valid acceleration requires both a clear notice of intent to
accelerate and a notice of the acceleration itself.1
Tolling & Resetting: A bankruptcy filing tolls the SOL for the duration of the automatic
stay.16 Prior to a 2019 law change, a partial payment could restart the SOL. Now, for debt
buyers, a payment does
not revive a time-barred debt.185 A lender can rescind a prior acceleration by sending a
clear notice, which would stop the 4-year clock and return the loan to an installment basis,
but this must be done before the SOL expires.
Effect of Expiration: Texas law is unequivocal. Upon the expiration of the 4-year
limitations period, the "real property lien and a power of sale to enforce the real property
lien become void".6 This completely extinguishes the security interest, and the lender
cannot foreclose. This makes Texas a high-risk jurisdiction for aged delinquent loans.

Utah

•

•
•

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Utah is primarily a non-judicial foreclosure state.186 The
SOL to enforce a promissory note is
6 years.187 The right to foreclose is tied to the enforceability of the note.
Triggering Events: The 6-year SOL runs from the due date or, if accelerated, the
accelerated due date.187
Tolling: Utah law does not appear to allow for "banking" of time tolled by a prior action to
be applied to a future limitations period.187 A bankruptcy stay would toll the statute under
federal law.
Effect of Expiration: If a lender fails to commence foreclosure (by filing a notice of
default) or file a lawsuit within the 6-year period, it forfeits its right to enforce the trust
deed, and the lien becomes unenforceable.187

Vermont

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Vermont is a judicial foreclosure state, using either a
"strict foreclosure" or a "foreclosure by judicial sale".188 The SOL for an action to enforce a
mortgage is based on the statute for recovery of lands, which is
15 years.190
Triggering Events: The 15-year period begins to run from the time the right of entry
accrues, which is the date of the borrower's default.191
Tolling: A bankruptcy filing will toll the SOL.192

•

Effect of Expiration: The Vermont Supreme Court has held that the expiration of the
SOL does not extinguish the underlying debt but only bars the remedy of foreclosure.190
This creates a "zombie mortgage" situation where the lien remains on the property,
clouding title, but cannot be actively enforced through foreclosure.

Virginia

•

•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Virginia allows both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with the non-judicial process being dominant.193 The SOL for an action on a
written contract is
5 years.195
Triggering Events: The 5-year SOL begins when the breach of contract occurs (i.e.,
upon default).196
Tolling: Virginia has a complex tolling statute that addresses events like the death of a
party or the filing of a nonsuit.197 A bankruptcy stay will also toll the statute.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 5-year SOL bars the foreclosure action and
renders the lien unenforceable.

Washington

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Washington permits both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with non-judicial being the most common.198 The SOL for an action on a
written contract is
6 years.199
Triggering Events: The SOL is complex. A separate 6-year period runs for each missed
installment payment. If the lender accelerates the loan, the 6-year SOL begins to run
on the entire balance. If the borrower files for bankruptcy and receives a discharge,
severing personal liability, the 6-year SOL on the in rem foreclosure action begins to run
from the date of discharge.199
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply. A written acknowledgment of the debt can
restart the SOL.200
Effect of Expiration: If the SOL expires, the foreclosure action is barred. A borrower may
be able to bring a quiet title action to remove the expired lien.

West Virginia

•

Period & Foreclosure Method: West Virginia allows both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures.201 The SOL for a written contract is
10 years.202 A separate, complex lien expiration statute also applies:
1. If maturity date is ascertainable, the lien expires 5 years after that date.

•
•
•

2. If maturity date is not ascertainable, the lien expires 35 years after the date of the
lien instrument.203
Triggering Events: The 10-year contract SOL is triggered by the breach (default). The
lien expiration statute is triggered by the maturity date or the instrument date.
Tolling: West Virginia has a specific statute tolling the SOL during a bankruptcy stay.204
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the applicable period under the lien expiration statute
(W. Va. Code § 55-2-5) extinguishes the lien and bars foreclosure.203

Wisconsin

•
•
•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Wisconsin is a judicial foreclosure state. The SOL for
an action on a promissory note is 6 years. The SOL on a judgment is 20 years.
Triggering Events: The 6-year period begins when the cause of action accrues, which
is the date of default or acceleration.
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 6-year SOL on the note bars the foreclosure
action.

Wyoming

•

•

•
•

Period & Foreclosure Method: Wyoming allows both judicial and non-judicial
foreclosures, with non-judicial being more common.205 The SOL for foreclosure by
advertisement is
10 years.206 The SOL for written contracts is also 10 years.207
Triggering Events: The 10-year period runs from the maturing of the mortgage or the
debt secured thereby. If the maturity date is not ascertainable from the mortgage, the
SOL runs from the date the mortgage was recorded.206
Tolling: Standard tolling provisions apply.
Effect of Expiration: Expiration of the 10-year SOL bars a foreclosure by
advertisement.206 The lien becomes unenforceable.

IV. Strategic Implications and Recommendations for
MBS Investors

A. Risk Mitigation and Servicing Protocols

The vast and complex landscape of state-specific SOLs necessitates a proactive and
sophisticated approach to loan servicing and portfolio management. Relying on a one-size-fitsall approach is a recipe for significant financial loss.
• Implement a Jurisdiction-Specific "SOL Alert System": Servicing platforms must be
enhanced to incorporate a dynamic SOL tracking module. For each loan, the system
should log the jurisdiction, the applicable SOL period(s), and the potential trigger dates
(e.g., date of first uncured default, date of acceleration, contractual maturity date). The
system must generate automated alerts for assets approaching their SOL deadline, with
escalating priority for those in high-risk states like Texas and New York. This is critical
because the event that starts the clock—often an acceleration notice—can be a routine
servicing action that, if not properly tracked, can lead to the inadvertent loss of the lien
years later.1
• Enforce Legally-Vetted Communication Protocols: All borrower communications
related to default must be standardized and legally vetted on a state-by-state basis. The
distinction between a "notice of default," a "demand letter," and a "notice of acceleration"
is not merely semantic; it is a legal distinction that can determine when a short and
unforgiving SOL period begins.1 Servicers must have clear, unambiguous protocols for
when to accelerate a loan and, in states where it is permitted and advantageous (like
Florida), how to validly decelerate a loan to reset the SOL clock following a dismissed
foreclosure.5

B. Due Diligence for Portfolio Acquisition

The risk of acquiring unenforceable liens is a primary threat to an MBS investor's returns. A
rigorous due diligence process focused on SOLs is essential.
• Mandate Loan-Level SOL Analysis: For any acquisition of non-performing or reperforming loan pools, due diligence must extend beyond basic credit metrics to a loanlevel legal analysis of SOL status. This requires a comprehensive review of the entire
servicing history, including all default notices sent to the borrower, and a full litigation
history for any prior foreclosure attempts. An investor cannot accurately value an asset
based on its origination date alone. A loan originated in 2006 could have had its SOL
triggered by an acceleration in 2018, making it a high-risk asset in a state with a 6-year
SOL. The history of prior dismissed foreclosures is particularly critical; in Florida, it may
reset the clock and make the loan safely enforceable, while in New York, it may mean the
lien is already void under FAPA.8
• Develop a "Lien Validity" Score: A quantitative risk score should be assigned to each
asset based on its SOL status. Factors should include the time remaining on the SOL, the
legal clarity of the trigger event in that jurisdiction, and the consequence of expiration (lien
extinguishment vs. remedy bar). Assets in high-risk states with SOLs nearing expiration
must be priced at a significant discount to reflect the binary risk of total collateral loss.

C. Jurisdictional Risk Management & The "Lien vs. Remedy"
Dichotomy

Not all expired statutes of limitations are created equal. Investors must understand and price the
critical difference between states where the SOL extinguishes the lien itself and those where it
merely bars the foreclosure remedy.
• In a state like Texas, an expired 4-year SOL renders the lien "void," and the collateral is
lost to the investor forever.6 The asset's recovery value becomes zero.
• In a state like Ohio or Vermont, the legal situation is more ambiguous. The expiration of
the SOL on the note may bar a deficiency judgment and potentially the remedy of
foreclosure, but the lien may survive as a "zombie mortgage".7 This dormant lien still
clouds the property's title. The homeowner cannot sell or refinance the property without
addressing it. This provides the investor with passive leverage; while they cannot force a
sale, they can wait for the borrower to initiate a transaction that requires clear title and
then negotiate a payoff. An asset with a zombie mortgage is not worthless, but its value is
significantly impaired due to the loss of an active remedy and the uncertainty of the
recovery timeline. This distinction must be incorporated into valuation models.

D. Monitoring Evolving Law

The legal environment for foreclosures is dynamic, with a clear trend in some states toward
greater borrower protection. New York's FAPA is a landmark piece of legislation that
dramatically shifted risk from borrowers to lenders.8 It is plausible that other states with large
foreclosure inventories and influential consumer advocacy groups could enact similar laws.
Investors must dedicate resources to monitoring state legislatures for proposals that could alter
SOL rules, particularly those that would limit a lender's ability to reset the clock after a failed
foreclosure attempt. Risk models must be flexible enough to adapt to these potential changes,
as a single new law can fundamentally alter the value and risk profile of an entire state's
portfolio.
