This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the NPLVision platform. It serves as a guide for feature development, organizing our work into logical phases that build upon each other to deliver increasing value to our users.

## âœ… Phase 0: Foundation & Core Functionality (Completed)

This phase focused on building the core, stable application shell and the essential data pipeline.

* **[DONE]** Implemented a robust data ingestion engine supporting both `.csv` and `.xlsx` files.
* **[DONE]** Established a "Current vs. History" database model with `daily_metrics` and `foreclosure_events` tables.
* **[DONE]** Built a functional **Loan Explorer** with a data table, sorting, and a powerful accordion-style filter panel.
* **[DONE]** Created a custom, reliable **Loan Detail Modal** to display at-a-glance information for a single asset.
* **[DONE]** Implemented a working **Export** feature for both PDF and Excel.
* **[DONE]** Established a professional, responsive **Application Shell** with persistent sidebar navigation.

## ðŸ”¨ Phase 1: High-Value Intelligence & UI Polish (Current Sprint)

The focus of this phase is to transform the functional application into a professional-grade analytical tool for our primary persona, "Alex the Active Manager."

### Immediate Next Steps

* **[QUEUED]** **Logo Design:** Create a simple, professional SVG logo and integrate it into the `SideNav`.

### Backlog for This Phase

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Enterprise Features & Reporting (Next Up)

This phase focuses on adding high-value features that support professional workflows and begin to serve our secondary "Sarah the Passive Investor" persona.
