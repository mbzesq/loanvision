This document outlines the strategic roadmap for the NPLVision platform. It serves as a guide for feature development, organizing our work into logical phases that build upon each other to deliver increasing value to our users.

## âœ… Phase 0: Foundation & Core Functionality (Completed)

This phase focused on building the core, stable application shell and the essential data pipeline.

* **[DONE]** Implemented a robust data ingestion engine supporting both `.csv` and `.xlsx` files.
* **[DONE]** Established a "Current vs. History" database model with `daily_metrics` and `foreclosure_events` tables.
* **[DONE]** Built a functional **Loan Explorer** with a data table, sorting, and a powerful accordion-style filter panel.
* **[DONE]** Created a custom, reliable **Loan Detail Modal** to display at-a-glance information for a single asset.
* **[DONE]** Implemented a working **Export** feature for both PDF and Excel.

* **[DONE]** Implemented a foundational **User Authentication** system with registration, login, and roles.
* **[DONE]** Successfully resolved the **Foreclosure Timeline Status** filter bug through systematic debugging and implementation of sophisticated cumulative variance calculation logic.

## ðŸ”¨ Phase 1: Middle-Value Intelligence & UI Polish (Current Sprint)

The focus of this phase is to transform the functional application into a professional-grade analytical tool for our primary persona, "Alex the Active Manager."

### Immediate Next Steps

* **[DONE]** **Fix Foreclosure Timeline Status Filter:** Resolved the critical bug that caused the Loan Explorer to crash when using this filter.
* **[DONE]** **Centralized Timeline Logic:** Implemented shared utility functions (`timelineUtils.ts`) following DRY principles to avoid code duplication.
* **[DONE]** **UI/UX Enhancements:** Relocate user profile menu, update branding text on login page, and integrate new company logo.
* **[DONE]** **Data Table Aesthetics:** Complete the aesthetic overhaul of the data table to match our "Schwab-inspired" design.
* **[DONE]** **Filter Panel UX:** Enhance the filter panel with a "search-within-filter" input for long lists of options.
* **[DONE]** **Logo Design:** Create a simple, professional SVG logo and integrate it into the `SideNav`.
* **[DONE]** **UI Cleanup:** Add City and State to the `Loan Explorer` table and `Loan Detail Modal` for better context.
* **[DONE]** **Upload Page Aesthetics:** Enhance the UI of the `UploadPage` and rename the tab for clarity.

### Backlog for This Phase

## ðŸš€ Phase 2: Enterprise Features & Reporting (Next Up)

This phase focuses on adding high-value features that support professional workflows and begin to serve our secondary "Sarah the Passive Investor" persona.

* **[PLANNED]** **Statute of Limitations Risk Analysis**: Build the statute of limitations analysis which combines state rules and loan data to determine if a loan is nearing, or is past, the statute of limitations, which will act as one input to the Financial Modeling backend services planned for Phase 3.
* **[PLANNED]** **Loan Detail Page V1:** Begin building out the Loan Detail Page, a page assigned to every loan uploaded to the platform, that houses all key data points including Loan Data, Property Data, and Credit Data.
* **[PLANNED]** **Dashboard V1:** Begin building out the main Dashboard page with a grid of dynamic widgets (KPIs, charts, actionable lists, market data ticker).
* **[PLANNED]** **Data Enrichment (Tier 1):** Implement python scraping integrations for property valuations, property photos, etc.
* **[PLANNED]** **"Soft Delete" for Loans:** Build the functionality to archive loans.
* **[PLANNED]** **Header Alias Mapping:** Enhance the backend ingestion engine to intelligently map common column name variations.
* **[PLANNED]** **Domain Migration:** Plan and execute the migration of the live application to the `https://www.nplvision.com` domain.
