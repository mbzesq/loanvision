## 1. High-Level Objective
To build a SaaS platform for ingesting, enriching, analyzing, and managing non-performing mortgage loan portfolios. The platform helps asset managers make better decisions by combining structured loan data, automated enrichment, and intelligent querying.

---

## 2. Core User Personas

### üë§ Alex the Active Manager
The primary user for the current phase. Alex is a portfolio analyst or asset manager responsible for hands-on review of individual loans and overall performance. They need real-time visibility into loan status, risk, and foreclosure pipeline.

### üë©‚Äçüíº Sarah the Passive Investor *(Future)*
Sarah is a stakeholder or capital partner. She prefers high-level dashboards, summaries, and trend visualizations instead of detailed loan-level data.

---

## 3. Core Technology Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite (TypeScript)
- **Backend**: Node.js + Express (TypeScript)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Render.com (split frontend/backend)
- **Repo**: [GitHub - loanvision](https://github.com/mbzesq/loanvision)

---

## 4. Current System Capabilities

### ‚úÖ Upload Engine (CSV + XLSX)
- Supports file uploads for:
  - Daily Portfolio Metrics
  - Foreclosure Events
- Dynamically detects column headers
- Accepts `.csv` and `.xlsx` formats

### ‚úÖ Database Support for Current + History Tables
- **daily_metrics_current**: Latest view per loan
- **daily_metrics_history**: Full audit trail by `loan_id + report_date`
- **foreclosure_events**: Current foreclosure status (one active per loan)
- **foreclosure_events_history**: Tracks all filings, including multiple foreclosure cycles
- **Automatic handling of historical preservation and active-state logic**

### ‚úÖ User Authentication System
- Supports user registration and login with secure password hashing (bcrypt)
- Implements token-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT)
- Includes foundational support for role-based access control (`super_user`, `admin`, `manager`, `user`)
- All data-fetching routes are now protected

### ‚úÖ Foreclosure Timeline Intelligence
- The detailed timeline view in the `LoanDetailModal` now displays color-coded status icons (On Time, Late, Overdue) for each milestone
- The Loan Explorer features a fully functional "Foreclosure Timeline Status" filter to find "On Track" or "Overdue" loans based on a cumulative variance calculation

### ‚úÖ Backend Infrastructure
- Corrected `fcl_milestones_by_state.json` path resolution
- Dynamic ingestion logic with robust logging
- Upload responses include insert/skipped/error counts and `report_date`

## 5. Evergreen Guardrails for AI (Claude)

### üõ°Ô∏è Stability First
- Never break working features; always preserve Loan Explorer, Upload, and Dashboard stability

### üß† Claude is Not All-Knowing
- Must use explicitly shared schemas and sample data
- Cannot infer structure from uploads‚Äîrequire clear mapping

### üß™ Nothing Is Trusted Until Verified
- All changes must be tested via Upload
- Deployment must follow validation in dev or local

### üß± Clear & Modular Design
- Code must be testable and organized
- Favor named helpers and TS interfaces

### üß≠ Project State Must Be Current
- Always begin with updated `claude.md`
- Time-stamp major changes (e.g. `v2025-06-20D`)

### üß∞ Build for the Future
- Plan for FTP automation, servicer-specific templates, and dashboard analytics
- Implement config toggles or placeholders for planned features

---

## 6. Most Recent Milestone and Last Session Summary (2025-06-26)
- ‚úÖ Implemented complete **User Authentication System** with registration, login, JWT tokens, and role-based access control
- ‚úÖ Successfully fixed the **Foreclosure Timeline Status filter** through multiple iterations, culminating in a sophisticated cumulative variance calculation
- ‚úÖ Centralized timeline logic in a shared utility (`timelineUtils.ts`) following DRY principles
- ‚úÖ All protected routes now require authentication tokens
- ‚úÖ The timeline filter now correctly identifies "On Track" vs "Overdue" loans based on their complete foreclosure journey

---

## 7. Next Steps
- **Implement UI/UX Enhancements.** The next priority is to refine the application's user experience by relocating the user profile menu, updating branding text on the login page, and integrating a new company logo.

## 8. Medium-Term Roadmap

| Phase | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Now   | Visualize daily metrics & foreclosure data |
| Next  | Report generation, rent valuation API, servicer dashboards |
| Later | AI assistant, predictive analytics, automated triggers |
